## Briefly About Myself:

I have an extensive experience in different professional areas, first of all 5 years experience in IT-sales and partner management. 
As for my personal qualities I would mention that I'm self-motivated, adaptable, responsible, good team worker and have an eye for detail. 
I am eager to learn and enjoy overcoming challenges. I also like to help my colleagues and newcomers and use my pedagogical background to couch another people comprehensible and patiently.
In January 2022 I started studying Frontend and I'm really in love with it. 
Currently I'm finishing big the online-course, doing final practice in web developement and also working at some personal projects.
